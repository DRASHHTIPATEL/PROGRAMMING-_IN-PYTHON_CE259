Dictionary

a. Write a Python script to check whether a given key already exists in a
dictionary.

b. Write a Python script to merge two Python dictionaries.

c. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary.

d. Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.

Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}

Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

e. Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a
new one.

Sample Dictionary :
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}

Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

1,2

b. Write a Python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the
set.

c. Write a Python program to create an intersection, Union, difference of sets.

d. Write a Python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set.

4. Write a Python program to find the most common elements and their counts
from list, tuple, dictionary.


Tuple

a. Write a Python program to create a tuple with different data types.

b. Write a Python program to create a tuple with numbers and print one item.

c. Write a Python program to add an item in a tuple.

**practical 3.Find Captain Room Number**

Sample Input

5

1 2 3 6 5 4 4 2 5 3 6 1 6 5 3 2 4 1 2 5 1 4 3 6 8 4 3 1 5 6 2

Sample Output

8

Explanation: The list of room numbers contains 31 elements. Since K is 5, there
must be 6 groups of families. In the given list, all of the numbers repeat 5 times
except for room number 8.

Hence, 8 is the Captain's room number.

**practical 4.** 
 Find runner-up from given list

Sample Input
5
2 3 6 6 5

Sample Output
5
Explanation: Given list is [2,3,6,6,5].
The maximum score is 6, second
maximum is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.

**practical 5.**
You are given a string and your task is to swap cases. In other words, convert
all lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa
.
Sample Input: HackerRank.com presents "Pythonist 2"
.
Sample Output: hACKERrANK.COM PRESENTS "pYTHONIST 2".

**practical 6**
You are given n words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences.
The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word.
See the sample input/output for clarification.
Sample Input 4 bcdef abcdefg bcde bcdef 
Sample Output 3 2 1 1 
Explanation:
There are 3 distinct words. Here, "bcdef" appears twice in the input at the first and last positions. The other words appear once each. The order of the first appearances are "bcdef", "abcdefg" and "bcde" which corresponds to the output.

**practical 7**
Lapindrome is defined as a string which when split in the middle, gives two halves having the same 
characters and same frequency of each cha odd number of characters in the string, we ignore the middle character and check for racter. 
If there 1,2 Page 3 of 3 are lapindrome. For example gaga is a lapindrome, 
since the two halves ga and ga have the same characters with same frequency.
Also, abccab, rotor and xyzxy are a few examples of lapindromes.
Note that abbaab is NOT a lapindrome.
The two halves contain the same characters but their frequencies do not match. Your task is simple. 
Given a string, you need to tell if it is a lapindrome


**practical 8**
Write a Program in Python to implement a Stack Data Structure using Class and Objects, with push, pop, and traversal method.
