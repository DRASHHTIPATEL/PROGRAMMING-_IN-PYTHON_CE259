3. Find Captain Room Number
Sample Input
5
1 2 3 6 5 4 4 2 5 3 6 1 6 5 3 2 4 1 2 5 1 4 3 6 8 4 3 1 5 6 2
Sample Output
8
Explanation: The list of room numbers contains 31 elements. Since K is 5, there
must be 6 groups of families. In the given list, all of the numbers repeat 5 times
except for room number 8.
Hence, 8 is the Captain's room number.
